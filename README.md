# Real Estate Application

This frontend-only project is a real estate application built with React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to browse available properties, view listings, and apply filters based on country, property type (house, apartment, etc.), and price range. The project utilizes advanced logic to dynamically handle filters and display relevant property cards.
